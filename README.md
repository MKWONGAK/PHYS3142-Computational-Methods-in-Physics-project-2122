# PHYS3142 Computational Methods in Physics project (2122)

This project is separated into three parts. 
The first part is to simulate the orbits of Mercury, Earth, and Mars by only considering the force from the Sun. After that, we compare it with the actual data, such as the orbital period. 
The second part is to simulate the three-body problem in which their mass is equal to our Sun. We test for three different initial conditions and observe whether the orbits are periodic or not. 
In the last part, we simulate the orbits of three moons of Jupiter, which are the Io, Europa, and Ganymede. 
We simulate them with and without considering the gravitational force between them in which we can compare the difference.
The Runge-Kutta method is used here.
